	 - What is the Spotify model?

	 - The Spotify model is a people-driven, autonomous approach for scaling agile that emphasizes the importance of culture and network.

	 - The Spotify model isn’t a framework, as Spotify coach Henrik Kniberg [noted](https://blog.crisp.se/2015/06/07/henrikkniberg/no-i-didnt-invent-the-spotify-model), since it represents Spotify's view on scaling from both a technical and cultural perspective.

	 - The Spotify model champions team autonomy, so that each team (or Squad) selects their framework (e.g. [Scrum](/agile/scrum), [Kanban](/agile/kanban), Scrumban, etc.). Squads are organized into Tribes and Guilds to help keep people aligned and cross-pollinate knowledge.

	 - Squads

	 - Similar to a scrum team, Squads are cross-functional, autonomous teams (typically 6-12 individuals) that focus on one feature area. Each Squad has a unique mission that guides the work they do, an agile coach for support, and a product owner for guidance. Squads determine which agile methodology/framework will be used.

	 - Tribes

	 - When multiple Squads coordinate within each other on the same feature area, they form a Tribe. Tribes help build alignment across Squads and typically consist of 40 - 150 people in order to maintain alignment (leveraging what we call [Dunbar's Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number)). Each Tribe has a Tribe Lead who is responsible for helping coordinate across Squads and for encouraging collaboration.

	 - Chapter

	 - Even though Squads are autonomous, it’s important that specialists (e.g. Javascript Developer, DBAs) align on best practices. Chapters are the family that each specialist has, helping to keep engineering standards in place across a discipline. Chapters are typically led by a senior technology lead, who may also be the manager for the team members in that Chapter.

	 - Guild

	 - Team members who are passionate about a topic can form a Guild, which essentially is a community of interest. Anyone can join a Guild and they are completely voluntary. Whereas Chapters belong to a Tribe, Guilds can cross different Tribes. There is no formal leader of a Guild. Rather, someone raises their hand to be the Guild Coordinator and help bring people together.

	 - Trio

	 - The Trio (aka TPD Trio) is a combination of a Tribe Lead, product lead, and design lead. Each Tribe has a Trio in place to ensure there is continuous alignment between these three perspectives when working on features areas.

	 - Alliance

	 - As organizations scale, sometimes multiple Tribes need to closely work together to accomplish a goal. Alliances are a combination of Tribe Trios (typically three or more) that work together to help their Tribes collaborate on a goal that is bigger than any one Tribe.

	 - The benefits of the Spotify model

	 - When Spotify changed the way they scaled agile they wanted to enable Squads to move fast, ship software quickly, and do so all with minimum pain and overhead. They realized these benefits and more as they took their model and evolved it. The organizational benefits of implementing the Spotify model include:

	 - More self-management and autonomy

	 - The Spotify model encourages autonomy and creativity by trusting people to complete the work they are doing in the way they see fit. Do you need to ship software? That’s up to the Squad. Do you need to change direction? That’s also up to the Squad.

	 - Spotify model best practices

	 - If you’re looking to enable a culture of trust, autonomy, and rapid learning, you can’t go wrong looking to the Spotify model for inspiration. If your organization is looking at the Spotify model as a means to help you approach [agile at scale](/software/jira/agile-at-scale), the following is a list of best practices to keep in mind.
