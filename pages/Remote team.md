- [How to collaborate across time zones](https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-work-asynchronously/)
	 - My team is spread across four states and three time zones. People often ask me how we find good times to meet. My answer: it's not easy, but it's also rarely necessary. Working remotely, especially when your team is distributed across the globe, means working asynchronously. And it's a skill.

	 - Zapier has nearly 300 employees scattered around the world, so it's not efficient—or even possible—to have quick, ad hoc meetings. We regularly need to act without the luxury of a real-time discussion, so we've adapted.

	 - Here are some tips for working outside the constraints of time, none of which involve quantum mechanics.

	 - One example of how we raise the communication bandwidth on the Design Team is through something called Design Club. Design Club is an inclusive space where anyone in the company can come to present their work for critique and provide feedback for others. This could be anything from research plans to visual designs from your product teams. We have both a Design Club Slack channel and a weekly Design Club video call where folks can sign up to receive asynchronous or real-time critique from their peers and stakeholders from around Zapier.
