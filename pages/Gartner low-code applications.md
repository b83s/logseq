- Strategic Planning Assumption

- By 2023, over 50% of medium to large enterprises will have adopted an LCAP as one of their strategic application platforms.

- Market Definition/Description

- IT leaders are facing mounting challenges around application delivery. Developer shortages and skill-set challenges are impacting their ability to deliver increasing levels of business automation in a rapid and reliable fashion. In response, the vendors of low-code application platforms (LCAPs) have been improving the ease at which business applications can be delivered, providing broader capabilities requiring smaller and less specialized teams of developers.

- An LCAP is characterized by its use of model-driven or visual development paradigms supported by expression languages and possibly scripting to address use cases such as citizen development, business unit IT, enterprise business processes, composable applications and even SaaS applications. These platforms are offered by vendors that may be better known for their SaaS offerings, or their business process management (BPM) capabilities, as well as specialist vendors for rapid application development. The primary goal is increased application development productivity with reduced skill-set requirements for developers.

- Gartner formally defines an application platform as “a product or suite of products that offers development, deployment and execution capabilities for any of user experience, business process, business logic, and data.”

- An LCAP is an application platform that supports rapid application development, deployment, execution and management using declarative, high-level programming abstractions such as model-driven and metadata-based programming languages, and one-step deployments. LCAPs provide and support user interfaces (UIs), business processes and data services.

- An enterprise LCAP supports enterprise-class applications. Enterprise-class applications require high performance, scalability, high availability (HA), disaster recovery (DR), security, service-level agreements (SLAs), resource use tracking, technical support from the provider, and API access to and from local and cloud services.

- Note that Gartner defines a no-code application platform as an LCAP that only requires text entry for formulae or simple expressions. The LCAP market therefore includes no-code platforms. Furthermore, “no code” is not a sufficient criterion for tasks like citizen development, as many complex tooling configuration tasks are “no code” but still require specialist skills.

- Vendors Added and Dropped

- We review and adjust our inclusion criteria for Magic Quadrants as markets change. As a result of these adjustments, the mix of vendors in any Magic Quadrant may change over time. A vendor’s appearance in a Magic Quadrant one year and not the next does not necessarily indicate that we have changed our opinion of that vendor. It may be a reflection of a change in the market and, therefore, changed evaluation criteria, or of a change of focus by that vendor.

- Added

- **AuraQuantic:** A vendor from the iBPMS market that satisfies our criteria for LCAP.

- **Newgen:** A vendor from the iBPMS and CMS market that satisfies our criteria for LCAP.

- Dropped

- **K2:** This vendor is focusing instead on the case management market.

- **Kony:** This vendor was acquired and is focusing now on the multiexperience development platform (MXDP) market.

- Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

- To qualify for inclusion, each vendor must:

- 1.  Demonstrate a go-to-market strategy with specific pricing for its low-code application platform (LCAP) for cross-industry application development, and not specific vertical markets and not included in some other capability or wider market.

- 2.  Provide application platform capabilities that:
	 - Include tools to develop, version, test, deploy, execute, administer, monitor and manage the applications and their relevant artifacts.

	 - Support the design of data schema and application logic.

	 - Embed data storage and user interface (UI) features without relying on additional procured services (i.e., includes a database).

	 - Enable the invocation of external third-party services via APIs and/or event topics.

	 - Support some automation of platform patching and versioning.

- 3.  Provide rapid application development. Each vendor must:
	 - Provide a low-code or no-code approach to development of UIs, business logic and data definitions.

	 - Support development and deployment of applications by developers in both central IT and line of business.

	 - Include single-step deployment.

	 - Include an application component repository for sharing components, integrations or applications.

- 4.  Be enterprise-grade and aimed at enterprise-class projects through the platform providing:
	 - High availability and disaster recovery.

	 - Secure access to applications.

	 - Technical support to customers.

	 - Third-party application access to application logic and/or data, via APIs and/or event topics.

- In addition to the above market and technical criteria, each participating vendor must adhere to the following **business criteria:**

- **Growth:** The vendor must have **20%** year-over-year growth in revenue for the previous year for LCAP licenses and subscriptions, excluding professional services or other related product offerings, in the last year ending 31 March 2020.

- **Revenue:** The vendor must have revenue of at least **$12 million** for LCAP licenses and subscriptions in the last year ending 31 March 2020.

- **Customer base:** The vendor must have at least **400 paying customer organizations** for its LCAP offering, excluding other related product offerings, as of 31 March 2020.

- **International support:** The vendor must have added at least 20 new, paying and named enterprise customer organizations for its LCAP in 2019, with at least 10 each within two of the following geographies: North America, South America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Asia/Pacific.

- We also **excluded** vendors that did not meet our market requirements exactly, using the following criteria:

- Require a specific, licensed, third-party component or product that is _not_ already OEM’ed into their platform(s) — that is, branded, sold and supported directly by vendor.

- Only sell their platform(s) with, and for the use of, their professional services and consultants.

- Assume the purchase and/or installation of other unrelated products or platforms offered by the same vendor (e.g., a CRM application or content management system).

- Did not market an offering in 2019 that was described as an application development offering (e.g., a SaaS vendor that provided an LCAP as part of its SaaS license only).

- Do not offer a commercially supported enterprise offering — that is, only offer the platform(s) as open-source software.

- Evaluation Criteria

- Ability to Execute

- Gartner views Ability to Execute as primarily concerned with product capabilities and sales execution and pricing. Due to COVID-19 in 2020, we dropped the customer reference survey from our process and thereby reduced the scoring of customer experience.

- Quadrant Descriptions

- Leaders

- LCAP Leaders are those that are demonstrating both execution (technically good product matched to good sales performance) and vision (both product innovation and commensurate marketing strategy). LCAP Leaders include major cloud SaaS providers (Microsoft, Salesforce, ServiceNow), specialist low-code providers (Mendix, OutSystems) and a hybrid process automation and low-code application vendor (Appian). These vendors have strong multifunction capabilities including application process, business logic and user experience, and moderate to strong ecosystems.

- Challengers

- LCAP Challengers are those that demonstrate strength in execution but only moderate or less vision. The single LCAP Challenger this year is Oracle with its Application Express (APEX) solution, which is widely used and technically competent, but Oracle’s vision does not match that of the Leaders or Visionaries in this Magic Quadrant. However, with continued extensions to their vision, Challengers could become Leaders in the future.

- Visionaries

- Visionaries in LCAP are those that demonstrate strengths in vision, but only moderate or less enterprise execution. LCAP Visionaries include SaaS providers (Oracle Visual Builder, Zoho), a citizen development vendor (Betty Blocks), and a hybrid process automation and low-code application vendor (Pega). These vendors display various approaches to innovation, but do not meet the same execution standards as the Leaders in terms of business levels or business models.

- Niche Players

- LCAP Niche Players have insufficient vision to be Visionaries, and insufficient execution to be Challengers. They include various and overlapping submarkets: hybrid process automation and low-code application vendors (AgilePoint, AuraQuantic, Creatio, Newgen, TrackVia), citizen development (Kintone, QuickBase), and field operations support (ProntoForms). While niche in the context of this Magic Quadrant, these vendors may be good choices for specific scenarios, domains and ecosystems, and in particular their pricing models are likely to be more relevant to a wider audience.

- Context

- This Magic Quadrant covers the top 18 vendors and 19 products in the LCAP market. Low-code application platforms cover a wide range of vendors including those that are:

- SaaS-centric vendors, delivering LCAP for SaaS customizations, extensions and net new applications.

- IT-centric, rapid application development LCAP vendors, providing productivity to IT development teams and replacing or supplementing pro-code environments such as native Java EE, .NET or cloud-native platforms.

- LCAP providers for business unit application development, typically focusing on business processes and often using technologies that have evolved from BPMS or iBPMS.

- Citizen IT or development vendors, targeting simpler workflows and data sharing applications, but increasingly overlapping in capabilities with the other LCAP types with a larger emphasis on no-code/configuration mechanisms.

- Gartner clients choose LCAP for their increased productivity, and the ability to deliver applications quickly with reduced team sizes including fusion teams using agile methodologies.

- Use cases are typically as follows:

- **Citizen development:** Building line-of-business, web-based, data-oriented applications by business citizen developers using no-code development from one day to two weeks. Targets B2E scenarios.

- **Business unit IT application:** Building new enterprise applications involving web, mobile, data, business logic and external services including SaaS services, within eight weeks. Targets B2B and B2E scenarios.

- **Enterprise IT business process application:** Automate long-running, changeable and complex business processes, workflows and case management involving sophisticated business logic, external services and multiple end-user roles. Targets B2E scenarios.

- **Fusion team-developed composite application:** Assemble application experiences from a portfolio of multisourced building blocks such as packaged business capabilities, SaaS, API products in marketplaces, existing data sources, event channels, cloud services and custom local services. These are custom application experiences for specific end-user roles and individuals.

- **Independent software vendor (ISV) mobile and web application for SaaS:** Build SaaS and ISV applications involving rich user experience on web and mobile, including end-user management and billing. Targets B2B and B2C scenarios.

- Market Overview

- The market for low-code application platforms (LCAPs) continues to grow with a high level of interest from Gartner clients in “low code” for both application development and other application-related uses such as integration and AI services.

- Large SaaS vendors such as Salesforce and Microsoft dominate the market, with their SaaS competitors introducing new LCAP entries, such as ServiceNow competitor Cherwell introducing an LCAP offering, or Salesforce competitor Xiaoshouyi promoting its LCAP called IngageApp PaaS.

- The overlap with the business process automation vendors continues to grow, reflected in AuraQuantic and Newgen being added to the LCAP Magic Quadrant vendor list for 2020. Some other vendors have specialized away from the general LCAP market, such as K2 moving to case management automation, and Temenos acquiring Kony and refocusing on the MXDP market.

- Of the major vendors in the application infrastructure and middleware services (AIMS) market, Salesforce has achieved No. 2 status in revenue based primarily on its Salesforce Platform LCAP, behind only IBM. Salesforce represents a large proportion of LCAP market revenue. Oracle’s No. 3 status in AIMS is supported by its two independent LCAP offerings that are given separate attention for this edition of the Magic Quadrant. At No. 4 is AWS, which recently introduced a beta version of its LCAP offering, Amazon Honeycode. Microsoft at No. 5 has Power Apps as its LCAP — a prime component of its Power Platform strategy. SAP and IBM both offer Mendix on their marketplaces. Meanwhile, the perils of low-code lock-in were demonstrated by Google cancelling its App Maker product and acquiring the wholly separate and incompatible AppSheet instead.
