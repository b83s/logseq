		 - **The Top of the Ladder**
What would it feel like to be safe and warm? Arms strong but gentle. Snuggled close, joined by tears and laughter. Free to share, to stay, to leave . . .

Some of the daily living experiences of this state include being
organized, following through with plans, taking care of myself, taking time
to play, doing things with others, feeling productive at work, and having a
general feeling of regulation and a sense of management.

		 - **Moving Down the Ladder**
Fear is whispering to me and I feel the power of its message. Move, take action, escape. No one can be trusted. No place is safe . . .

The world is a dangerous place and I need to protect myself from harm.‚Äù Some of the daily living problems can be anxiety, panic attacks, anger, inability to
focus or follow through, and distress in relationships.
