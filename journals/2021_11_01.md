- [[Tuindeco fase 2]]
	 - Toon overleg over escalaties aanleveren klanten en prijzen. 

- [[HKV Shopware 6]] Meeting volgende week mailen naar maarten dat dit bij nacalc project prijzen hoort.

- [[Pim]] [[Sollicitant]] [[Recruitment]]
	 - Wouter Dieters

	 - Frontend? 

	 - Meer sturen vanuit het bedrijf

	 - Product owner - team lead.
		 - Consultancy 

- [[Ergonode]] cron 
	 - Some of events will not have handlers as are prepared for extending the current functionalities and not needed for now - meaning the logs does not claim there's actually something wrong.

So the reason for the features not working is the fact that consumers are not running. To run a consumer u should run
bin/console messenger:consume {transport} for tranports:
 batch_action
 core
 export
 notification
 import
 segment
 completeness
You can obviously customize the consumers for your needs so to do that run bin/console messenger:consume -h  to see possibilities
Hope it helps
