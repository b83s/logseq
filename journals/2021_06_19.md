** Getting Started with Braintoss
------------------------------------------------------------

Braintoss is very easy to use. Braintoss uses different components of your phone to make it easier to drop your thoughts in your inbox.

Braintoss will send a file to your inbox of the note you typed, the picture you took or the audio you recorded.

Yet to make the email easier to use we will try to describe the picture, transcribe the audio or even create a PDF or vCard of your document or business card.

We can highly recommend putting the Braintoss app close at hand, like your first screen or the dock. This way opening the app when you want to save a thought is quick and easy.

We value our own thoughts and use Braintoss to keep them safe!

Happy Braintossing, cheers from the Braintoss team

PS If you love Braintoss please leave us a nice review in the App Store. It means the world to us. Thank you!
